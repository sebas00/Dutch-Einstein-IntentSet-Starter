# Dutch Einstein Starter Intent Set

Ever since I built an Einstein bot and used it for my kids I wanted it to be in Dutch, I used some workaround before but from the Winter ’21 release (so October 2020) we’ll have Dutch NLP in Einstein Chatbots!

To test it out and get customers up and running I’ve created a Intent set that has common intents for Cases, Orders and Appointments.

Also includeds well are Entities for Dutch Postcodes, NL and BE Provinces and IBAN number

You can get a pre-release developer org to test it out, and then install the unmanaged package to install a QuickStart Dutch Einstein Intent Set

To install use this direct link to Unmanaged package (will only work on pre-release orgs)
